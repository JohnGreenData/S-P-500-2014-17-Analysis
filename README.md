S&P 500 Analysis (2014–2017)  
Anticipating returns, volatility, and trading patterns using data

Project overview  
This project addresses the challenge of using historical market data to inform long-term investment planning, risk awareness, and operational decision-making. By analysing S&P 500 trading data, I produced insights into returns, volatility, and trading behaviour across the index.

Business problem  
Stakeholders wanted to understand how the S&P 500 performed over time, which stocks delivered the strongest returns, how volatile key stocks were, and how trading volume varied. The goal was not to predict markets, but to use data to better inform long-term investment and operational decisions.

Approach
 - Cleaned and analysed S&P 500 trading data from 2014 to 2017
 - Created metrics for returns, trading volume, and volatility
 - Compared absolute vs percentage measures to improve decision-making
 - Analysed index-wide trends alongside individual stock performance

Key insights
 - The average stock in the S&P 500 grew by 49.3% over the period, supporting long-term investing
 - Trading volume is highest later in the week, but daily anomalies are frequent
 - Nvidia delivered exceptional growth (over 1100%), while Amazon showed more consistent long-term performance
 - Percentage volatility provides more meaningful insight than absolute volatility when comparing stocks over time

Recommendations
 - Use index-level averages to inform long-term financial planning rather than short-term trading
 - Prefer percentage-based volatility measures for fair comparison across time
 - Avoid staffing or operational decisions based solely on average daily trading volumes
 - Treat short-term price movements with caution due to high variability

Tools and technologies
 - Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
